- use pnpm as the package manager
- must store new versions and features in a changelog.md file
- use typescript
- use svelte for the frontend
- use electron for the backend
- use tailwind css for styling
- use vite for the build tool
- keep you code lean, prevent duplication. for that reason you must first search if the code already exists someplace else before writing it.
